## Requirements: Behavior-Driven Design and User Stories

### Concepts

  1. User Stories
  2. Low-Fidelity(Lo-fi) user interfaces and storyboards.
  3. Points to turn users stories in estimate schedule.
  4. Velocity to measure and stimate schedule.
  5. Using the tool **Cucumber** to transform user stories into acceptance tests.
  6. Using the tool **Pivotal Tracker** to track project progress, to calculate velocity, and to  estimate time to milestones.

### 7.1 Introduction to Behavior-Driven Design and User stories

  "*Behavior-Driven Testing is Test-Driven Development done correctly.*"
                                                                    --Anonimous

  We start the agile lifecycle with Behavior-Driven Design(BDD). The goal of BDD is **validation**(Build the right thing) not just **verification**(Build the thing right).
  The BDD Version of requiriments is **user stories**, which describe how the application is expected to be used. In BDD the stories take the place of design documents in plan-and-document.

  By concentrating on *behavior* of the application versus the *implementation* of application.
  The general guidelines for the user stories is that they must be **testable**, **small** to be implemented in one iteration and have **business value**.
