## Requirements: Behavior-Driven Design and User Stories

### Concepts

  1. User Stories
  2. Low-Fidelity(Lo-fi) user interfaces and storyboards.
  3. Points to turn users stories in estimate schedule.
  4. Velocity to measure and stimate schedule.
  5. Using the tool **Cucumber** to transform user stories into acceptance tests.
  6. Using the tool **Pivotal Tracker** to track project progress, to calculate velocity, and to  estimate time to milestones.

### 7.1 Introduction to Behavior-Driven Design and User stories

  "*Behavior-Driven Testing is Test-Driven Development done correctly.*"
                                                                    --Anonimous

  We start the agile lifecycle with Behavior-Driven Design(BDD). The goal of BDD is **validation**(Build the right thing) not just **verification**(Build the thing right).
  The BDD Version of requiriments is **user stories**, which describe how the application is expected to be used. In BDD the stories take the place of design documents in plan-and-document.

  By concentrating on *behavior* of the application versus the *implementation* of application.
  The general guidelines for the user stories is that they must be **testable**, **small** to be implemented in one iteration and have **business value**.

* **User Story Format**

    Feature name
      as a [kind of stakeholder],
      so that [I can achieve some goal],
      I want to [do some task]

### 7.2 POints, Velocity, and Pivotal Tracker
  The **backlog** is the name of the collection of stories that have not yet been completed in this iteration.
  **Velocity** measures work rate based on the team's self-evaluation. As long as the team rates user stories consistently, it doesn't matter whether the team is completing 5 points or 10 points per iteration. The purpose is to give all stakeholders an idea how many iterations it will take a team to add the desired set of features, which hepls set reasonable expectations and reduces chances of disappointement.
  
  [Pivotal Tracker][1] is a service that tracks user stories and velocity. You can also use 
  [Trello][2] which offer some of it's features for free.
